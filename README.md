# iamsophie.sk

I'm Sophie S-K, a thirty-something, 6'2″ web developer based in Wiltshire.

A graduate of Web Design from UWE in Bristol, I like drinking coffee, listening to music, art, fantasy writing, roleplay gaming, and knitting. Amongst other things. _Mostly_ in that order. ... and cats. I _really_ like cats.

My aim is to leave a positive legacy. Whether that's by mentoring people, improving code, sharing ideas, supporting folks, documenting and formalising processes, or advocating for changes that will benefit the whole team, I strive to leave things better than how I found them. We're all in this together.
