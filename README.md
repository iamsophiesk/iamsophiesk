I'm Sophie S-K, a thirty-something, 6'2â€³ web developer based in Wiltshire.

A graduate of Web Design from UWE in Bristol, I like drinking coffee, listening to music, baking, drawing, knitting, crochet, roleplay gaming, aikido, cross stitching and fantasy writing. And cats. I really like cats.

I'm here to do good things for good people. Whether that's helping folks directly, reducing my environmental footprint, or sharing resources, I strive to leave things better than I found them. We're all in this together.
