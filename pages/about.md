Hi! My name is Sophie Shanahan-Kluth, though I normally go by Sophie S-K. My full name often doesn't fit into name fields, so the shorter version will do.

I'm a full-stack developer based in Wiltshire. I moved here from Bristol, where I studied Web Design at UWE, and am now living with my partner and our three cats: Juno, Maia and Augustus. I like cats, coffee, music, cats, art, writing, cats, and knitting. Amongst other things. _Mostly_ in that order.

I started working with the web when I was about thirteen, creating pages on Neopets, Geocities and AvidGamers. I thought of myself as a web designer, focusing on making pages look pretty rather than functional (and, you know, legible). Through university and in the roles I've held since then I gravitated towards back-end development work. Curiosity led me to picking up dev-ops and systems administration, necessity steered me towards supporting with project management and Scrum processes, and position has led me to line management.

I'm happy to turn my hand to any task, and am often one of the first people to volunteer to pick things up. Nowadays I'm a full-stack Drupal tech lead, so there isn't any one thing I do "most" of the time - but it's fair to say I thrive when working on gnarly integration problems. I'm always open to learning something new, or to helping others learn.
