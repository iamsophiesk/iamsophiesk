<section>

  I'm Sophie, a thirty-something, 6'2″ web developer with ADHD based in Wiltshire.

  A graduate of Web Design from UWE in Bristol, I like drinking coffee, listening to music, art, fantasy writing, roleplay gaming, and knitting. Amongst other things. _Mostly_ in that order. ... and cats. I _really_ like cats.

  My aim is to leave a positive legacy. Whether that's by mentoring people, improving code, sharing ideas, supporting folks, documenting and formalising processes, or advocating for changes that will benefit the whole team, I strive to leave things better than how I found them. We're all in this together.

  ### Study

  #### BSc(hons) in Web Design

  Studied at <abbr title="University of the West of England">UWE</abbr> Bristol from September 2009 to July 2013, graduating with a first class degree.

  My final year project was Fontastica, a font finder. Using Google's font API, the site provided random combinations of fonts in header-body format and allowed users to rate them ("I like this!" or "This sucks!"). Its purpose was to give designers ideas for type combinations on websites, assuming that it's either difficult to come up with a good combination, or they stick to the same old thing.

  It was built using CodeIgniter between October 2012 and April 2013. The accompanying report was written throughout the year alongside the project work.

  Other modules included:

  *   Final year: a digital media project (Fontastica), interaction design, consultancy project (working with Bristol Women’s Voice), advanced topics in web development (creating a RESTful API system)
  *   Third year: placement at [Circle Interactive](http://circle-interactive.co.uk/)
  *   Second year: human-computer interaction, information architecture, web design principles
  *   First year: information design, media technologies (basic knowledge of Flash and ActionScript 3.0 programming)

  ### What I can bring to the table

  My key drivers are: honesty, openness, and a commitment to betterment.

  I've been working with the web since I was 13, and am a firm believer in making things simple and easy to use, both for the end user and for any developer who will take up work after me. I'm keen to broaden my horizons and learn new things, rather than stagnating in a single place.

  I work best with people who are driven and details-oriented, and thrive when given a lot of work to do and a deadline. I enjoy taking the time to get stuck into a project, understanding the objectives and seeing the project through to the end. I don't like leaving tasks half-finished, although I do get bored if a project drags on needlessly.

  I'm a huge believer in laying solid foundations for future work: unless strictly necessary I don't cut corners during development if I can help it. It feels like a disservice to a team of developers to build technical debt in, and I will strive to build things correctly the first time around. If I can't, I do my best to document (through tickets in a backlog, or in a Wiki or equivalent) the things that will need improving. I don't just code for me, I code for a team, and they are at the forefront of my mind, always.

  I enjoy learning and sharing new knowledge with others. In previous roles I have acted as a mentor, helping to teach students and junior devs how to assess priorities, discover solutions, and ultimately complete their own work in a thorough, timely manner. My emphasis is on teaching people to be strong independent learners, with keen attention to detail and a desire to achieve the best.

  Oh ... and I really like writing documentation! I know that sounds weird, but I think it’s important to make it as easy as possible for others to pick up systems. I get frustrated when documentation isn’t provided, so I do my best to provide it for others. I have pushed for the adoption of documentation systems across several teams, including Confluence, Notion and various company-built intranets and wikis.

  I love to focus on health - not only my health but that of my colleagues and friends. Maintaining a healthy mind and body is a really important thing for anyone to do, so I push for all of my colleagues to keep an eye on their work-life balance and offer support wherever I can. As a qualified Mental Health First Aider, I try to look out for signs of mental fatigue in my colleagues, offering support and advice wherever I can.

  Feedback on my self and my behaviours is important to me, and I actively encourage people to let me know if I can improve myself. I've spent the last few years learning to take feedback at face value rather than personally. It's been a hard road of learning that not everyone else feels the same way, but that's one of the many things I'm learning!
